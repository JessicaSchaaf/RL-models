# RL-models

This repository contains .txt files in which several types of RL models (simple, hierarchical (with and without stimuli) and hierarchical PSRL (with and without stimuli)) are implemented. These .txt files are used to sample parameter values in JAGS via the code supplied in the .R files. A separate file is added to deal with missing data.
